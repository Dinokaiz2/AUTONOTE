#AUTONOTE
##Automatic Ubiquitous Text Outputter for the Negation Of Typing Exercises


Thanks for using AUTONOTE!

This application's purpose is to create a "snip" of the screen -- a screenshot,
but only a section of the screen rather than all of it -- and attempt to extract
the text from the image.

code goes to StackOverflow user Hans Passant.
